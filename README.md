# TDM20100
I am currently taking a seminar course, TDM 20100, as part of [The National Data Mine Network](https://datamine.purdue.edu/). I am training to use Unix utilities, bash scripts, and SQL to store, access, and manipulate data in this course. I will be posting all of my projects for this course here.
